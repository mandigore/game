This is a text based game I'm working on, clearly it's a wreck as I am a beginner and would very much appreciate some help.
I am self taught and my wonderful boyfriend, Nick, is working on adding in some art pieces for the npc portraits and the enemies and such.
It is very much a work in progress and I plan to add in a lot more features.
I have not figured out how Git works as I do not have it installed on my Mac so I will simply copy paste for updates.
Assume NOTHING is permanent, this is all an experiment to get a rough draft going, a VERY rough draft.
